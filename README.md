Hello mate, it's big aug here!

I use the pronouns he/him/bad programmer.

Naw, but jokes aside, hi, I'm Auguste! I'm a programmer that loves trying out new things! I'm currently doing things with Zig and the Zig Community, and so far, it's been a bundle of fun!

I'm working on a piece of software that will enable me to embed a soft of interactive svg website thing in here - hopefully I'll finish that soon!
