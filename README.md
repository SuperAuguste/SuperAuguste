Hello mate, it's big aug here!

I use the pronouns he/him/bad programmer.

Naw, but jokes aside, hi, I'm Auguste! I'm a programmer that loves trying out new things! I'm currently doing things with Zig and the Zig Community, and so far, it's been a bundle of fun!

I'm working on a piece of software that will enable me to embed a soft of interactive svg website thing in here - hopefully I'll finish that soon!

<svg height="100" width="500">
  <ellipse cx="240" cy="50" rx="220" ry="30" style="fill:yellow" />
  <ellipse cx="220" cy="50" rx="190" ry="20" style="fill:white" />
</svg>
