## Recruiters

I'm a solutions-oriented traditional computing-based real-time multi-experience change-maker working on creating novel best-in-breed tooling to disrupt, transform, and datafy the software industry. I've been utilizing the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/) to ameliorate code literacy with cutting-edge end-to-end technology. Cloud computing. Machine learning. Digital divide. Metaverse. Web3.

## Normal people

Hey, I'm Auguste and I work on language tooling, protocols and formats, hacky interpreters, and all sorts of other fun projects, primarily in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)! My main "claim to fame" is [zls](https://github.com/zigtools/zls), a language server for Zig which implements completions, goto def, and more to help Zig programmers be more productive. Feel to reach out by joining the [Zig Discord](https://discord.gg/zig) and DMing \@aurame.
