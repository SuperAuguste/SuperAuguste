# hi

Hey, I'm Auguste and I work on language tooling, protocols and formats, hacky interpreters, and all sorts of other fun projects, primarily in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)! My main "claim to fame" is [zls](https://github.com/zigtools/zls), a language server for Zig which implements completions, goto def, and more to help Zig programmers be more productive. Feel to reach out by joining the [Zig Discord](https://discord.gg/zig) and DMing \@aurame.

Some of my areas of include:
- Tooling, specifically language and editor tooling
- The Java Virtual Machine
- Protocols and formats of all sorts
